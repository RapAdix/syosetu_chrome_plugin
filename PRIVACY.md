## 🔐 Data Storage and Usage

### API Keys (OpenAI, Gemini, etc.)
- API keys are entered by the user in the extension’s settings or in an optional `secrets.js` file.  
- These keys are stored **only locally** on the user’s machine (via Chrome storage or the file system).  
- They are used exclusively to send requests directly to the selected provider’s API.  
- At no point are these keys transmitted to the developer or to any third party other than the chosen API provider.  

### 📖 Jisho Dictionary Queries
- Recent queries and grammar results are cached locally in Chrome storage.  
- This allows faster responses and access to past lookups.  
- These are **never transmitted** outside the user’s machine.  

### 🚫 No Tracking
- The extension does not include analytics, tracking, or advertising.  
- No personal data is collected.
